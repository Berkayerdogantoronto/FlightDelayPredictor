I used the confusion matrix method to generate an array, which shows the number of True Positive, False Positive, True Negative and False Negative. Using those factors, i computed the most important statistics to 
measure the performance of our models. I am aware that there is no perfect machine-learning algorithm. It is essential to test alternative algorithms for this reason.  
In the project, three algorithms are selected to train the same dataset. The prediction results are shown in Figure 1. The best outcome is displayed.
Through Logistic Regression when two out of three evaluation indices exceed 0.8 and are the highest among the three models. Meanwhile, Naive Bayes has a relatively poor performance.
