# Flight Delays Prediction
All commercial flights that departed the Washington, D.C., region and arrived in New York in January 2004 are listed in the FlightDelays.csv file.  Whether a flight is delayed is the variable that we are attempting to predict. An arrival that is at least 15 minutes later than expected is considered a delay.
